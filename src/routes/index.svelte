        <p>We are all consumers of our cities&rsquo; policies regarding public space and municipal services. Increasingly, policymakers understand that for policy to be successful, all individuals and organisations who have a stake in the policy need to be heard.</p>

        <p>In participatory processes guided by consultants, we can identify three perspectives: street, system, and researcher. And four activities: identify partners, connect with local context, gather data and doing analysis, reflecting on effects with all stakeholders. Ideally, each stakeholder gets involved in every activity, and the activities get executed over multiple iterations (cycles).</p>
        
        <p>The &lsquo;Agora&rsquo; platform plays a supporting role for mutual reflection. First as a tool through which knowledge and experience is recorded in a central place, and second by enabling the reorganisation of these experiences from multiple perspectives. It makes explicit how knowledge from each perspective gets translated and abstracted by visualising interconnections between all the parts that make up the whole.</p>
        
        <p>By keeping the integrity of each individuals&rsquo; contribution on display in a central place, anyone can track how the policy came to be- and how their individual perspective was translated to conclusions. The system perspective can see how individuals contributed to challenging their assumptions, and experience the expertise that stakeholders have of their surroundings.</p>
        
        <p>This leads to transparent and integral city policy.</p>
